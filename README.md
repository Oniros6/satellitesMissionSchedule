# satellitesMissionSchedule

This program is conbined with an unfinished paper. That paper will not be published since I do not continue my research in the mission schedule of 
satellites. 
The paper is here:  [Missionschedule]（https://github.com/loceyi/satellitesMissionSchedule/edit/singleAgileSatellite/Missionschedule.liu.pdf ）
I try to build a framework to deal with mission schedule problems by using reinforcement learning. I brought up with a complete framework 
to do this and get some results. I can not make sure whether it will have better performance than other algorithms but it is a good way to try it. I change my research area then due to my own interest and no longer work on this topic. If it can help anyone, I will be very glad. Please contact with me if you have any problems, or exciting ideas. Discussion is always a good thing.
